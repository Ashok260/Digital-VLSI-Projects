# Digital VLSI Projects

This repository contains a collection of Verilog HDL codes covering various digital design concepts. These designs demonstrate fundamental and complex circuits often used in Digital VLSI systems.

## Projects Overview:

### 1. Adders
- **Full Adder**
- **Half Adder**
- **Ripple Carry Adder**
- **Carry Look-Ahead Adder**

Each implemented using multiple Verilog description styles (behavioral, structural, dataflow).

### 2. Behavioral Description Codes
- Codes illustrating different behavioral modeling techniques in Verilog.

### 3. RISC-V Pipeline Design
- A simplified RISC-V processor pipeline, implemented with multiple stages, for educational purposes.

### 4. System Design
- **Greatest Common Divider (GCD)**
- **Multiplication using Repeated Addition**

### 5. Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- **Mealy FSM** for sequence detection.
- **Moore FSM** for sequence detection.
  
These demonstrate both FSM types with different implementation techniques.

### 6. SRAM
- Simple SRAM design with read/write capabilities.

### 7. Car Parking System
- A digital car parking system implemented using Verilog.

### 8. Decoders
- **2-to-4 Decoder**
- **3-to-8 Decoder**

### 9. Encoders
- **4-to-2 Encoder**
- **8-to-3 Encoder**

### 10. Multiplexers
- **2-to-1 MUX**
- **4-to-1 MUX**
- **8-to-1 MUX**

# NB-IoT Uplink Transmitter Chain

This section includes Verilog HDL implementations of sub-systems used in the NB-IoT uplink transmitter chain.

## Sub-Systems Overview:

1. **Turbo Encoder**
   - Implements error-correction coding for reliable communication.

2. **Channel Interleaver**
   - Ensures data resilience against burst errors by rearranging data sequences.

3. **DMRS (Demodulation Reference Signal)**
   - A module designed to assist in coherent demodulation.

4. **Project Report**
   - Detailed documentation of the NB-IoT Uplink Transmitter Chain.
